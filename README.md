# Online Demo Shop

This website was originally my university-industry collaboration project (self-taught in sophomore, 2017). 

After the project was finished in 2018 and I onboard the next team, I removed intellectual properties and logos related to the original industry partner. Displaying the source code as my own personal project.

The website has few key functions.
- Product display
- Taking orders
- Tracking orders
- Backstage for editing products and viewing incoming orders.

To run this website:
1. Create a MariaDB or MySQL database with the script in /dbsql/OnlineDemoDB_Restore_Script.sql
2. Modify appsettings.json connection string
3. Execute command 'dotnet run'
